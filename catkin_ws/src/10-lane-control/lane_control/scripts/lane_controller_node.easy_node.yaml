    Note: there is some very funny business inside. It appears that `k_d` and `k_theta` are switched around.

parameters:
    v_bar:
        type: float
        desc: Nominal linear velocity (m/s).

    k_theta:
        type: float
        desc: Proportional gain for $\theta$.

    k_d:
        type: float
        desc: Propertional gain for $d$.

    d_thres:
        type: float
        desc: Cap for error in $d$.

    theta_thres:
        type: float
        desc: Maximum desired $\theta$.

    d_offset:
        type: float
        desc: A configurable offset from the lane position.
