### Description {nonumber="1"}



`what-the-duck` is a program that tests *dozens* of configuration
inconsistencies that can happen on a Duckiebot.

### The `what-the-duck` program {#what-the-duck}

The proper usage of `what-the-duck` to debug an environment problem is the following
sequence:


    $ # open a new terminal
    $ cd ![Duckietown root]
    $ git checkout master
    $ git pull
    $ source environment.sh
    $ ./dependencies_for_duckiebot.sh # if you are on a Duckiebot
    $ ./dependencies_for_laptop.sh    # if you are on a laptop
    $ make build-clean
    $ make build-catkin
    $ ./what-the-duck

Note: you have to do all the steps in the precise order.
