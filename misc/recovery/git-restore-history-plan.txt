1.	find a recent commit (like e.g. Aug 1) where everything is good.

    export COMMIT=cbca9ee028155a1eedb0b1b61470a7e747482a1b

2.	move the folders where we want them to be. Write the

    export WHERE=/tmp/good-Software

    git clone git@github.com:duckietown/Software ${WHERE}
    git -C  ${WHERE} checkout ${COMMIT}



3.	applying a mega diff in one commit that add our recent work.
This will make us lose the recent few weeks of history, but it's ok. (Also I like the idea of having this "mega commit" with all the refreshed stuff.)



    git checkout cbca9ee028155a1eedb0b1b61470a7e747482a1b
    git reset --hard cbca9ee028155a1eedb0b1b61470a7e747482a1b


    git checkout -b recovery-script-6
    git reset --soft origin/andrea-config
    git checkout origin/andrea-config


    git checkout -b good-starting-point

    git checkout origin/andrea-config
    git checkout -b recovery-script-8

    git reset --soft good-starting-point
